    "### Question 13.2\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, you will simulate a simplified airport security system at a busy airport. Passengers arrive according to a Poisson distribution with $\\lambda_1 = 5$ per minute (i.e., mean interarrival rate $\\mu_1 = 0.2$ minutes) to the ID/boarding-pass check queue, where there are several servers who each have exponential service time with mean rate $\\mu_2 = 0.75$ minutes. [Hint: model them as one block that has more than one resource.] After that, the passengers are assigned to the shortest of the several personal-check queues, where they go through the personal scanner (time is uniformly distributed between $0.5$ minutes and $1$ minute). \n",
    "\n",
    "Use the Arena software (PC users) or Python with SimPy (PC or Mac users) to build a simulation of the system, and then vary the number of ID/boarding-pass checkers and personal-check queues to determine how many are needed to keep average wait times below 15 minutes. Note: If youâ€™re using SimPy, or if you have access to a non-student version of Arena, you can use $\\lambda_1 = 50$ to simulate a busier airport.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results summary\n",
    "\n",
    "For the simulation where the mean passenger arrival rate is 5, we find that the optimal configuration yielding mean wait time just below 15 minutes was with 5 id scanners and 9 personal checkers (time of 14.639845305).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the simulation where the mean passenger arrival rate is 50, we find that the optimal configuration yielding mean wait time just below 15 minutes was with 35 id scanners and 31 personal checkers (time of 14.9797373981).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we would need to include costs in our final analysis as well. If personal checkers are twice as expensive as id scanners, we would choose a solution that has fewer personal checkers (for example num_id= 36  and num_pc= 20 yields a time of 14.7139433891).\n",
